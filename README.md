## What is Token Monitor?

A desktop widget that shows live token usage across your AI coding tools — Claude Code, Codex, and Hermes — with cost breakdowns per client and per model.

It runs entirely on your own machine by default. An optional hub aggregates usage across multiple devices, including iPhones via a Cloudflare Worker.

Only summary numbers ever leave your machine. Raw prompts, source files, and conversation transcripts stay local.

## Features

- Live token tracking for Claude Code, Codex, and Hermes — UI updates within seconds of each turn
- Switch breakdown views — group totals by tool, device, or model
- Cost breakdown alongside token counts
- Appearance controls — adjust glass opacity/blur and window look (including transparent glass)
- Local-first — no servers needed for single-device use
- Real-time multi-device sync over Server-Sent Events (self-hosted hub or Cloudflare Worker)
- iOS widget support (Widgy, Scriptable) through the Worker hub
- Privacy-first — only summary numbers ever leave your machine

## Supported Tools

Token Monitor reads usage from these AI coding tools out of the box:

| Tool | Data path |
|------|-----------|
| Claude Code | `~/.claude/projects/`, `~/.claude/transcripts/` |
| Codex | `~/.codex/sessions/` |
| Hermes | `$HERMES_HOME` or `~/.hermes/` |

Detection and parsing are handled by [tokscale](https://github.com/junhoyeo/tokscale).

## Installation

### 1. Single device — Local mode

The default. No hub, no agent, no config.

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Usage is read live from your local AI client directories — `~/.claude/`, `~/.codex/`, and `$HERMES_HOME` (or `~/.hermes`). The widget updates the moment those files change, with a 5-minute fallback poll.

### 2. Multiple devices on your network — Self-hosted hub

Run the hub once on a machine that stays on, then open the widget on each device and point it at the hub.

```bash
# on the always-on machine
cp config.example.json config.local.json
# set hub.secret to something private, then:
npm run hub

# on every device that should contribute or display usage
npm start
# Settings → Multi-device Sync → fill in Hub URL + Secret, Save
```

When sync mode is active the widget contributes this device's usage automatically. Run `npm run agent` only if you want a headless agent on a machine without a widget.

See [docs/API.md](docs/API.md) for the hub HTTP API reference.

### 3. Across networks, including iPhone — Cloudflare Worker hub

A Worker-based deployment that speaks the same protocol as the Node hub.
Public HTTPS, no always-on machine, free tier covers small-team usage,
reachable from Widgy / Scriptable on iOS.

```bash
cd worker
npm install
npx wrangler login
npx wrangler secret put TOKEN_MONITOR_SECRET
npx wrangler deploy
```

Wrangler prints the deployed URL — paste it into each device's widget at Settings → Multi-device Sync. The widget contributes usage automatically; a standalone agent is only needed on machines without a widget.

See [worker/README.md](worker/README.md) for full deploy notes, the iOS widget
recipe, and endpoint reference.

## How it works

```text
Mode A — Local (default, no setup)
    widget (Electron) ──▶ tokscale ──▶ ~/.claude, ~/.codex, $HERMES_HOME

Mode B — Sync (opt-in, multi-device)
    device A agent ──▶
    device B agent ──▶  hub  ──▶  widget on any device
    device C agent ──▶
```

The widget switches modes automatically based on whether a Hub URL is set in settings. There is no separate "mode" toggle. In sync mode the hub pushes aggregated stats to every connected widget over Server-Sent Events, so updates on one device appear on the others within a few seconds.

## Settings

Click the `⚙` button in the widget header to open the Settings panel.

- **Multi-device Sync** — Hub URL and secret. Leave Hub URL empty to run in local mode (this device only).
- **Appearance** — system glass, live dot, glass opacity, and glass blur.
- **Advanced** — opens `settings.json` for less-common options like which clients to track and the `allTimeSince` start date.

The pin button in the widget header toggles "always on top".

## Privacy

The hub and agent only transmit summary fields:

- device id, hostname, platform
- total tokens per period (today / month / all-time)
- cost totals (when `tokscale` returns cost data)
- per-client and per-model breakdowns

They do not transmit raw AI logs, prompts, source code, or conversation
content. `config.local.json`, `data/`, and `node_modules/` are gitignored.

## Requirements

- macOS or Windows
- Node.js 18.17+
- For sync mode only: network reachability from each agent/widget to the hub
